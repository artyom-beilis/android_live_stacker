<h1>Access Error</h1>
<p>
    It was discovered the OpenLiveStacker application does 
    not have permissions to update files in <code>Documents/OpenLiveStacker</code>
    directory. It is likely that you uninstalled and installed new version
    rather than updating it.
</p>
<p>
    In order to fix the issue please rename or remove the directory OpenLiveStacker.
    New directory with correct permissions will be created.
</p>
<p>
    If you are using ASTAP, once you rename the OpenLiveStacker to something else
    and open the application once again. New directory structure with
    correct permissions is going to be created.
    Now you can move the <code>db</code> directory to the newly working directory
    of OpenLiveStacker and continue using it.
